         MINI GAMES

     <p>
         Mini games are so much more different to normal
         Minecraft play. Here's a guide on how to play them:

         First let's talk about the Batlle mini game. It is by far the most annoying one. You start off on glowstone and then you are 
         invicible for around ten seconds. For those ten seconds, people usually try and take the middle chests and then run off to find 
         chests around the map. Some people are hoarders and stay in the middle for the whole game but you can just shoot them with poisoned
         arrows and a bow or you could splash them with a potion and storm them with your weapons. The best thing to do is explore the map
         when hardly anyone is there and discover the most hidden chests. Just search the whole map and once you've found those chests and use 
         them regularly, you can begin to see a pattern of what armour and weapons it gives you.
